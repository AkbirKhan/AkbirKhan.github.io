## About


I'm a research engineer, interested in Machine Learning and its applications for topics including NLP, Social Justice and Security. I work at Spherical Defence Labs, a London based start-up, which uses deep learning to create intrusion detection systems.

I mainly blog here as a form of Feynamn Test, normally about my thoughts/rants on Machine Learning advances and other things which take my interest.
