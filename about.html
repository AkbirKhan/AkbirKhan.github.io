## About


I'm a research engineer whos interested in Machine Learning and its applications for topics including NLP, Social Justice and Security. I'm currently working at Spherical Defence Labs, a London based start-up, which uses deep learning to make better Intrusion Detection Systems.

I mainly blog here about my thoughts/rants on Machine Learning advances and other things which take my interest.  Check out my Github <a href="https://github.com/am-khan/" target="_blank">[here]</a>.
