Iâ€™m a Research Engineer, interested in Machine Learning and its applications for topics including AI Safety, robustness and security. I work at Spherical Defence Labs, a London based start-up, which uses deep learning to create intrusion detection systems.

I mainly blog here as a form of Feynman test, normally about my thoughts on Machine Learning advances and other things which take my interest.
